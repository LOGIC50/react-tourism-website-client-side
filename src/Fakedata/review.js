        review: 'Our gulet cruise from Kos to Patmos was everything and more than expected. It lived up to the Tour Takers Travels emphasis on culture, history, archaeology, comfort and camaraderie. Exceptional guides attended to each guests interests and needs and were exceptional hosts. Very enjoyable were swimming in secluded bays, the wonderful food quality and selection and the sites visited on each island. It was all one could hope for and a strong inducement to do another PST adventure very soon.'

        review: 'What a wonderful experience! The two tour leaders who were archaeologists enthralled us with the history of the Islands. The food was bountiful. On the boat the meals were wholesome and delicious. We were treated to wonderful meals on the the Islands that let us sample each Islands speciality. There was free time on each of the Islands that allowed for shopping, exploring or sitting round watching island life sipping a drink'

        review: 'Tour Taker runs a a highly professional organization. From his brochure to drop off at the airport to fly home his attention to detail and his consideration for his clients is superb. The archaeologists he uses as guides are erudite but highly personable and have an ability to turn a pile of stones into a recreation of the lives of the people who lived there over two millennia ago. Excellent'
